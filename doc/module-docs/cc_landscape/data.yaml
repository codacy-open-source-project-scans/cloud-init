  title: Install and configure landscape client
  description: |
    This module installs and configures ``landscape-client``. The landscape
    client will only be installed if the key ``landscape`` is present in
    config. Landscape client configuration is given under the ``client`` key
    under the main ``landscape`` config key. The config parameters are not
    interpreted by cloud-init, but rather are converted into a ConfigObj
    formatted file and written out to the `[client]` section in
    ``/etc/landscape/client.conf``.

    The following default client config is provided, but can be overridden::

        landscape:
            client:
                log_level: "info"
                url: "https://landscape.canonical.com/message-system"
                ping_url: "http://landscape.canoncial.com/ping"
                data_path: "/var/lib/landscape/client"

    .. note::
        see landscape documentation for client config keys

    .. note::
        if ``tags`` is defined, its contents should be a string delimited with
        ``,`` rather than a list
