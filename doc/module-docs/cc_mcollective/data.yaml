  name: Mcollective
  title: Install, configure and start mcollective
  description: |
    This module installs, configures and starts mcollective. If the
    ``mcollective`` key is present in config, then mcollective will be
    installed and started.

    Configuration for ``mcollective`` can be specified in the ``conf`` key
    under ``mcollective``. Each config value consists of a key value pair and
    will be written to ``/etc/mcollective/server.cfg``. The ``public-cert``
    and ``private-cert`` keys, if present in conf may be used to specify the
    public and  private certificates for mcollective. Their values will be
    written to ``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-public.pem`` and
    ``/etc/mcollective/ssl/server-private.pem``.

    .. note::
        The ec2 metadata service is readable by non-root users.
        If security is a concern, use include-once and ssl urls.
  examples:
  - comment: |
      Provide server private and public key and provide the following
      config settings in /etc/mcollective/server.cfg:
        loglevel: debug
        plugin.stomp.host: dbhost

      .. warning::
        The ec2 metadata service is a network service, and thus is
        readable by non-root users on the system
        (ie: 'ec2metadata --user-data')
        If you want security for this, please use include-once + SSL urls
