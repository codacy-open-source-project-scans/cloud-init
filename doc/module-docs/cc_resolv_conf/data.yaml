  title: Configure resolv.conf
  description: |
    Unless manually editing :file:`/etc/resolv.conf` is the correct way to
    manage nameserver information on your operating system, you do not want to
    use this module. Many distros have moved away from manually editing
    ``resolv.conf`` so please verify that this is the preferred nameserver
    management method for your distro before using this module.

    Note that using :ref:`network_config` is preferred, rather than using this
    module, when possible.

    This module is intended to manage resolv.conf in environments where early
    configuration of resolv.conf is necessary for further bootstrapping and/or
    where configuration management such as puppet or chef own DNS
    configuration.

    When using a :ref:`datasource_config_drive` and a RHEL-like system,
    resolv.conf will also be managed automatically due to the available
    information provided for DNS servers in the :ref:`network_config_v2`
    format. For those that wish to have different settings, use this module.

    In order for the ``resolv_conf`` section to be applied,
    ``manage_resolv_conf`` must be set ``true``.

    .. note::
        For Red Hat with sysconfig, be sure to set PEERDNS=no for all DHCP
        enabled NICs.
