cc_apt_configure:
  name: Apt Configure
  title: Configure apt for the user
  description: |
    This module handles both configuration of apt options and adding
    source lists.  There are configuration options such as
    ``apt_get_wrapper`` and ``apt_get_command`` that control how
    cloud-init invokes apt-get. These configuration options are
    handled on a per-distro basis, so consult documentation for
    cloud-init's distro support for instructions on using
    these config options.

    By default, cloud-init will generate default
    apt sources information in deb822 format at
    :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/<distro>.sources`. When the value
    of `sources_list` does not appear to be deb822 format, or stable
    distribution releases disable deb822 format,
    :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` will be written instead.

    .. note::
        To ensure that apt configuration is valid yaml, any strings
        containing special characters, especially ``:`` should be quoted.

    .. note::
        For more information about apt configuration, see the
        ``Additional apt configuration`` example.

  - comment: "cloud-init version 23.4 will generate a deb822 formatted sources file at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<distro>.sources instead of /etc/apt/sources.list when  `sources_list` content is deb822 format."
