cc_bootcmd:
  name: Bootcmd
  title: Run arbitrary commands early in the boot process
  description: |
    This module runs arbitrary commands very early in the boot process,
    only slightly after a boothook would run. This is very similar to a
    boothook, but more user friendly. The environment variable
    ``INSTANCE_ID`` will be set to the current instance id for all run
    commands. Commands can be specified either as lists or strings. For
    invocation details, see ``runcmd``.

    .. note::

        bootcmd should only be used for things that could not be done later
        in the boot process.

    .. note::

       when writing files, do not use /tmp dir as it races with
       systemd-tmpfiles-clean LP: #1707222. Use /run/somedir instead.
